# Boolean_identities
## Communicative Laws
- (x OR y) = (y OR x)
- (x AND y) = (y AND x)
## Associative Laws
- (x AND (y AND z)) = ((X AND y) AND z)
- (x OR (y OR z)) = ((X OR y) OR z)
## Distributive Laws
- (x AND (y OR z)) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
- (x OR (y AND z)) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)
## De Morgan Laws
- NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
- NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)
